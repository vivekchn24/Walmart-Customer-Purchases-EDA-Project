1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Count of the product-Names,Date/Month/Year-Wise-Product-Purchases etc.

3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Gender/Product-Category,Product-Amount Wise Purchases etc.
