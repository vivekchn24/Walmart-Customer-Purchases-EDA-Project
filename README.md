# Walmart-Customer-Purchases-EDA-Project
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing customer purchase records from Walmart. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, sales trends, and product preferences to support data-driven decision-making.

## **📁 Dataset**

- ""Source"": Walmart Customer Purchases public dataset (Downloaded from Kaggle / official source )
- ""Rows"": Aprrox 49,000+
- ""Columns"": 11+ (various Product-Names & Product-Types,Payment details,etc.)

## **📂 Walmart-Customer-Purchases-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project Folder Contains**

- WALMART_CUSTOMER_PURCHASES_DATA_ANALYSIS_EDA_PROJECT_VIVEK_CHAUHAN (Jupyter Notebook Code Pdf File)
- WALMART_CUSTOMER_PURCHASES_EDA_PROJECT_VIVEK_CHAUHAN (PowerPoint Presentation Slides Pdf File)
- DATA CSV FOLDER CONTAINS ORIGINAL DATASET

## **📌 Key Objectives :-**

- Cleaned and structured the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies if any
- Analyzed customer demographics including gender, age group, Repeat-Customers, Discounts-Appied or Not
- Explored purchasing patterns based on product categories, city tiers, and purchase amount
- Created clear and insightful visualizations to understand the distribution of spending and customer segments

## **🔧 Tools & Technologies Used :-**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

## **📌 Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping irrelevant or redundant columns
   - Formatting and type conversion

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Count of the product-Names,Date/Month/Year-Wise-Product-Purchases etc.

3. Bivariate Analysis
   - Gender/Product-Category,Product-Amount Wise Purchases etc.

4. Multivariate Analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Factors affecting loan defaults

5. Insights & Conclusions
   - Summarized key findings with visual charts
   - Business recommendations

## **🎯 Outcome:**

- This project helped reinforce skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and business insight extraction — providing a solid foundation for real-world retail analytics.

## **✅ Walmart EDA Project – Key Recommendations:-**

1.Target Adults & “Other” Gender – Highest purchase group, run personalized
offers.

2.Boost Electronics & Smartphone Sales – Expand variety, offer combos (e.g.,
phone + headphone).

3.Focus on Teenagers for Electronics – Use social media + student discounts.

4.Promote Debit Cards & UPI – Offer cashback; UPI highest in 2025 &
November.

5.Saturday = Sales Day – Plan major campaigns and offers on Saturdays.

6.Support Repeat Customers – Launch a loyalty rewards program.

7.Improve Ratings – Investigate 1-star feedback, upgrade service to turn 4★ into 5★.

8.Increase Purchase Amount – Push combo deals to cross ₹500 mark.

9.Fix Low Sales in Feb & 31st – Run end-of-month or Valentine’s offers.

## **📎 This project does not include business insights. It is intended for practice only.**

## **⚠️ Important:-**

- The code, analysis, and outputs in this project are not to be copied and used elsewhere, including in resumes or other projects that's why i attached jupyter notebook pdf only.The goal of this project is to practice and improve my skills, not to provide ready-to-use solutions.

-->Feel free to refer to the attached Jupyter notebook PDF for practice and understanding the concepts. This project is meant to showcase my personal learning journey through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and you can use it as a reference to practice and enhance your skills in data analysis.

## **📌 Disclaimer:**

-This EDA project is created purely for learning and practice purposes; hence, I’ve shared only the PDF versions of the Jupyter Notebook and PowerPoint to maintain originality and avoid direct copy-paste.
